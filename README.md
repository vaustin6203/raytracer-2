For this project I expanded on my PathTracer by implementing the ability to render new materials including mirrors, glass, and microfacet conductors. This was done by exploring new BRDFs for reflection, refraction, and microfacet modeling. I also enabled a new importance sampling method optimized for rendering microfacet materials. Throughout this project I compare how manipulating different parameters that characterize different materials and using different sampling techniques for rendering effect the overall outcome of the image. I also implemented the ability to render different depth of fields for an image.
